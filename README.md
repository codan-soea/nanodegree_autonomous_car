## Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Capstone Project

<center>**CAR-X** Team</center>

### Overview

The System Integration project is the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

The goal of this project is to code a real self-driving car to drive itself on a test track using [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware). The project is coded to run on Udacity simulator as well as on Udacity's own self-driving car [CARLA](https://medium.com/udacity/how-the-udacity-self-driving-car-works-575365270a40).

As a team, we built ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following.

For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

### Architecture

Using the Robot Operating System (ROS), each team member has developed and maintained a core component of the infrastructure that is demanded by the autonomous vehicle. The three core components of any good robot are the following:

- Perception: Sensing the environment to perceive obstacles, traffic hazards as well as traffic lights and road signs.

- Planning: Route planning to a given goal state using data from localization, perception and environment maps.

- Control: Actualising trajectories formed as part of planning, in order actuate the vehicle, through steering, throttle and brake commands.

### Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases/tag/v1.2).

### Sections

- **Waypoint Updater and Publisher** Node:
  - subscribes to `/base_waypoints` and `/current_pose` and publishes to `/final_waypoints`.
  - Once you have correctly identified the traffic light and determined its position, you can convert it to a waypoint index and publish it.
  - Use `/traffic_waypoint` to change the waypoint target velocities before publishing to `/final_waypoints`.

- **DBW** Node: Once your waypoint updater is publishing `/final_waypoints`, the waypoint_follower node will start publishing messages to `the/twist_cmd` topic. At this point, you have everything needed to build the `dbw_node`. After completing this step, the car should drive in the simulator, ignoring the traffic lights.

- **Traffic Light Detection and Classifier**:
  - Detection: Detect the traffic light and its color from the `/image_color`. The topic `/vehicle/traffic_lights` contains the exact location and status of all traffic lights in simulator, so you can test your output.
  - Classifier:


### Roadmap

  - Build the nodes described
  - Testing with the provided simulator
  - Upload a video sample
  - Update the README file to include the details

### Contribution

Each of the four team members in `Car-X` team should handle a sections.

Assuming `Eqbal` is handling the `dbw_node`:

- Create a branch with the first two name initiative followed by the section name: `git checkout -b eq-dbw_node`

- Commit the changes (better to have many comments with description description rather than one long commit)

- Once you are stuck push your branch so everyone in the team can check out the updates ( *don't push the code all together once you are done but rather than incrementally keep pushing changes* ): `git push -u origin eq-dbw_node`

- For testing please keep your python notebooks inside `./notebooks` folder.

- Please don't apply the changes directly to `master`

### Task break down table
To break down tasks and manage our task we'll be using [Github Project management](https://github.com/marketplace/category/project-management) check out the link below:

### Team Members:

  - [Eqbal Quran](www.eqbalq.com) (info@eqbalq.com)

	> Eki has already written a book about Ruby 5.0. Itâ€™s currently
sealed up. In three years, Matz is going to open the book to see if the
language design team got it right.

  - Jaime Blasco (pinoch0@gmail.com)
	> Jaime's addition operator doesn't commute; it teleports to
where he needs it to be

  - Dimitrios Mavridis (dmavridis@gmail.com)

	> Dimitrios's code doesn't follow a coding convention. It is the coding convention.
	
  - Mani Srinivasan (srnimani@gmail.com)
	> Mani does not use revision control software. None of his code has ever needed revision.

  - Volodymyr Seliuchenko (volodymyr.seliuchenko@gmail.com)
	> Volodymyr's coding reputation is only as modest as it is because of integer overflow (SQL Server does not have a datatype large enough)


### Usage

1. Clone the project repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
	```

2. Install python dependencies

	```bash
	cd CarND-Capstone
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. Make and run styx

	```bash
	cd ros
	catkin_make
	source devel/setup.sh
	roslaunch launch/styx.launch
	```

4. Run the simulator

### Running code on CARLA

In order to run the code on CARLA, it is necessary to use a different classifier. At the moment we are using an SVM in the simulator environment, while a FCN is used to detect traffic lights in the real world.

Therefore, it is necessary to download the trained FCN network (based on VGG) snapshot.

Due to the size of the file, it cannot be hosted in GitHub, so please use the following link to download:[Trained FCN snapshot](some_url_after_checking_with_carx_team).


### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2_h37bMVw3iYkdJTlRSUlJIamM/view?usp=sharing) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_files.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_files/loop_with_traffic_light.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
